        <p id="p1"> Coming from a diverse background that includes a liberal arts education and extensive marketing experience, Jacob Franklin brings business acumen and a unique perspective to software development. After graduating from the University of Minnesota in 2015, he worked in several marketing roles before transitioning to project and account management. Overseeing the development of front-end websites and back-end data systems introduced him into the IT workforce. As he broadened his technical literacy, he began to work in technical operations for multiple organizations before landing at Revel Health in 2017. Here he would learn his first coding languages while developing a love for all things tech.<br>
        </p>
        <p id="p2">In September 2018, Jacob enrolled in a six-month, full-stack coding bootcamp at the University of Minnesota. Through the course of this extensive program, he would acquire both front and back-end capabilities as a software developer. As a front-end web developer at Revel, Jacob specializes in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. He also has experience with Powershell, MySQL, Mongo, and C#.
